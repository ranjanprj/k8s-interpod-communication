# Containerized microservice challenge 
1. Implement a piece of software exposing a JSON document: 
  
   `{ "id": "1", "message": "Hello world" }` ... when visited with a HTTP client 

2. Dockerize the application 

3. Put the application to Minikube Kubernetes 

4. Create a second application, that utilizes the first and displays a fully reversed message text rendered dynamically

5. Automate deployment of the 2 applications using a script 

6. As a result of the task, provide us an archive with the deployment script (called `script.sh`) and all necessary files which we can use to deploy your applications and verify the solution
